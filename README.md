Project Overview 

 

The Quiz App is a mobile app developed as part of an assignment in the [IMAD5112] subject. This Android app is built using Kotlin and Android Studio. 

 

The primary purpose of the app is to provide questions that puts the users football knowledge to test. It helps users better their football knowledge . The project includes the use of GitHub for version control and automation via GitHub Actions. 

 

Purpose and Features 

 

Purpose 

 

The app generates a statement and the user has to press a button (true/false) if they think the statement is either true or false. 

 

Key Features 

• Statement Generation: Generates one out of five statements with all of them being either true or false. 

• Next Input: A button to that allows the user to be taken to the scoresheet after their input. 

• Exit Button: Allows users to close the application. 

 


Design Considerations 

1. User Experience (UX): Designed with a simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation. 

2. Responsiveness: Ensures compatibility with different screen sizes. 

3. Simplicity: Focused on core functionality without unnecessary complexity. 

4. Performance: Optimized for fast response times and efficient resource usage. 

 

GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization 

 

This project uses GitHub for version control, enabling proper tracking of changes and maintaining project integrity. 

 

GitHub Actions 

 

GitHub Actions were implemented to: 

• Automate Testing: Run automated tests to check app functionality. 

• Build Automation: Generate APK and AAB files for distribution. 

• Continuous Integration: Ensure the app is automatically built and tested on every push.

Challenges and Learnings 

 

Challenges Faced 

1. Handling Incorrect Inputs: Users entering exit button without progressing to the next page. 

• Solution: Begin button has been placed so that the user can begin the quiz. 

2. Exiting the Application Properly: Handling the exit function correctly. 

• Solution: Used finishAffinity() and exitProcess(0) to close the app smoothly. 

 

Learnings 

• Improved Kotlin programming skills, particularly in UI handling and event-driven programming. 

• Learned the importance of proper input validation and error handling. 

• Gained experience in using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. 

 

Future Enhancements 

• User Preferences: Allow users to be free about thier choice. 

• Dark Mode: Add a dark mode option for better usability.
